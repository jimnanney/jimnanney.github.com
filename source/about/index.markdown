My name is Jim Nanney.  I love to play with computers and make them do incredible things. I am a perpetual student of software craftsmanship.  I've done many things with computers since I was a young kid in the early 80s.  My first computer was purchased in 1980 and had so little room on it that this page wouldn't even fit. I am also a father of 3 wonderful girls and a husband to the most intelligent, beautiful, creative woman in the world.

In the past I have done many things, and seem to have become a jack of all trades. I have run BBSs (pre-internet message boards).  I have been a systems admin and network admin. And yes, I have some pretty good linux chops.  I got my RHCE in 2010.  I have written C and assembly code.  I have built hardware devices including my own VGA card. I've developed firmware for several hardware projects.

Currently, I live in Biloxi, MS and work as a developer building web applications.  As a hobbyist, I build iphone apps and am in the process of learning Ruby and Rails.  Ruby seems to be the most fun language I have ever dealt with and the Ruby community is fantastic.  I had the pleasure of attending RubyConf 2012 and even brought my wife along.  It peaked her interest, and completely changed my whole outlook on the developer community and what more is available in the world.  I have a new found love of Ruby and its welcoming, diverse community.

I am working toward learning and mastering Ruby and hope to share my knowledge along the way here.
